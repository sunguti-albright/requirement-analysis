# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring the concept of **requirement analysis** within the software development lifecycle. Requirement analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a system or project.

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Provide structured insights into the role of requirement analysis in building successful software.  
- Document key principles, techniques, and deliverables involved in requirement gathering and specification.  
- Serve as a reference point for learners and developers to understand how clear requirements guide design, development, and testing.  

By maintaining this repository, the goal is to highlight the importance of requirement analysis as the foundation for creating user-focused, efficient, and maintainable software solutions.
