# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring the concept of **requirement analysis** within the software development lifecycle. Requirement analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a system or project.

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Provide structured insights into the role of requirement analysis in building successful software.  
- Document key principles, techniques, and deliverables involved in requirement gathering and specification.  
- Serve as a reference point for learners and developers to understand how clear requirements guide design, development, and testing.  

By maintaining this repository, the goal is to highlight the importance of requirement analysis as the foundation for creating user-focused, efficient, and maintainable software solutions.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the **bridge between ideas and implementation**, ensuring that the software product delivered truly solves the user’s problems while staying within scope, budget, and time.

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where the needs, expectations, and goals of stakeholders are gathered, studied, and documented.  

It ensures that developers, designers, and business teams share a clear understanding of what the system should achieve before actual development begins.

### Importance in SDLC
- **Foundation for Development**: Serves as the blueprint for design, coding, and testing.
- **Avoids Miscommunication**: Aligns stakeholders (clients, users, developers) on what needs to be built.
- **Reduces Costs**: Identifying and fixing misunderstandings early is far cheaper than after coding has started.
- **Ensures Quality**: Clearly defined requirements make it easier to verify that the final product meets user expectations.
- **Guides Project Scope**: Prevents scope creep by defining what is included (and excluded) in the project.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement analysis serves as a foundation for building reliable, cost-efficient, effective and user-centered software. 

1. **Prevents Misunderstandings**  
   Requirement Analysis ensures that all stakeholders — from clients to developers — share the same understanding of what the system should accomplish.  
   *Example:* If requirements are not clarified, developers may implement features differently from what the client expected, leading to rework.

2. **Saves Time and Cost**  
   Identifying issues, gaps, or conflicts at the requirement stage is much cheaper than discovering them during development or testing.  
   *Example:* Fixing a design flaw after coding has started may require rewriting large portions of code, increasing both time and cost.

3. **Improves Quality of the Final Product**  
   Clear, well-documented requirements act as a benchmark for design, implementation, and testing. This ensures the end product meets user needs and functions as intended.  
   *Example:* Defining usability requirements early can result in a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
 Requirement Analysis usually involves a few important activities that help teams understand what needs to be built and how to capture it properly. These include:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting information from stakeholders, users, and customers about what they expect from the system.  
  *Example:* Meeting with stakeholders to understand their main goals.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Digging deeper into those needs through interviews, surveys, workshops, or direct observation.  
  *Example:* Watching how users currently complete tasks to identify pain points.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Writing down the requirements in a structured and clear way so that everyone can refer to them later.  
  *Example:* Creating user stories, use cases, or a requirements document.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Checking the requirements for clarity, feasibility, and consistency, and representing them with simple models or diagrams.  
  *Example:* Drawing a flowchart to show how a user will move through the system.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy and completeness.  
  *Example:* Holding a review session to ensure everyone agrees on what the system should do. *

## Types of Requirements.

### Functional Requirements
These describe **what** the system should do—the specific features or actions it must support.

**Examples for the hotel booking project:**
- Users can search for available hotels by city, check-in, and check-out dates. :contentReference
- Users can view hotel details, choose a room, and make a booking. :contentReference
- The system handles payments and sends booking confirmations. :contentReference

### Non-Functional Requirements
These outline **how** the system performs—the qualities it must exhibit rather than specific features.

**Examples for the hotel booking project:**
- The system should respond quickly—e.g., display search results within 2 seconds. 
- It must be secure and protect user data and payment information. 
- The system should scale to handle many users and maintain reliability even under heavy load. 

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between system actors (like users or managers) and the system itself. They help teams quickly understand system functionality and user expectations.

## Acceptance Criteria  

Acceptance Criteria are the conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by the end-user, customer, or other stakeholders. They act as a checklist that confirms whether a requirement or feature has been implemented successfully. Well-defined acceptance criteria help developers, testers, and business analysts ensure that the final product meets user needs and expectations.  

### Why Acceptance Criteria are Important
- **Clarity:** They remove ambiguity by clearly defining what "done" means.  
- **Alignment:** They ensure all stakeholders (developers, testers, clients) have the same understanding of requirements.  
- **Testing:** They provide a foundation for writing test cases.  
- **Scope Management:** They prevent scope creep by setting boundaries on what is included in a feature.  

### Example: Checkout Feature in Booking Management System  

**Feature:** Checkout  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The system should allow a user to select a booking and proceed to checkout.  
- The system should display the total cost, including taxes and fees.  
- The system should allow payment via credit/debit card, PayPal, or mobile money.  
- A confirmation receipt should be generated and sent to the user’s email after successful payment.  
- If payment fails, the user should be notified and given the option to retry or select a different payment method.
