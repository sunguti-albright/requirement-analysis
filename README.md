# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring the concept of **requirement analysis** within the software development lifecycle. Requirement analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a system or project.

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Provide structured insights into the role of requirement analysis in building successful software.  
- Document key principles, techniques, and deliverables involved in requirement gathering and specification.  
- Serve as a reference point for learners and developers to understand how clear requirements guide design, development, and testing.  

By maintaining this repository, the goal is to highlight the importance of requirement analysis as the foundation for creating user-focused, efficient, and maintainable software solutions.

## What is requirement analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where the needs, expectations, and goals of stakeholders are gathered, studied, and documented.  
It ensures that developers, designers, and business teams share a clear understanding of what the system should achieve before actual development begins.

### Importance in SDLC
- **Foundation for Development**: Serves as the blueprint for design, coding, and testing.
- **Avoids Miscommunication**: Aligns stakeholders (clients, users, developers) on what needs to be built.
- **Reduces Costs**: Identifying and fixing misunderstandings early is far cheaper than after coding has started.
- **Ensures Quality**: Clearly defined requirements make it easier to verify that the final product meets user expectations.
- **Guides Project Scope**: Prevents scope creep by defining what is included (and excluded) in the project.
